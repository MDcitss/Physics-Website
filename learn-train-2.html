        Consider an observer who is inside a moving train, and another observer standing stationary outside of the train.
        <br><br>
        Using the theory of special relativity, they can perform many experiments with light waves that show that ‘time’ is flowing at different relative speeds 
        between them. 
        <br><br>
        Here is one such experiment. The observer on the train places a mirror flat on the train floor, and flashes a light bulb on the roof of the train such
        that a light wave travels from the bulb, directly down onto the mirror, and back up to the bulb.
      </p>
      <img src="diagrams/Diagram_1.1.png" alt="Diagram 1">
      <img src="diagrams/Diagram_1.2.png" alt="Diagram 1">
      <p>
        From the observer inside the train’s perspective, the light travelled directly downwards and then directly upwards. The distance traveled by the light beam
        is d0=2h, and the speed it travelled at is always constant at c. Using time = distance / speed, the time elapsed for this observer is t0 = 2h/c.
        <br><br>
        However the observer outside the train would witness this event in a different way because while the light is making its journey up and down, the train is
        also moving within their reference frame from left to right.
      </p>
      <img src="diagrams/Diagram_2.1.png" alt="Diagram 2">
      <img src="diagrams/Diagram_2.2.png" alt="Diagram 2">
      <img src="diagrams/Diagram_2.3.png" alt="Diagram 2">
      <p>
        The light must travel a larger distance from the stationary observer’s perspective, but the speed of light would still be observed to be constant at c.
        Therefore, the time elapsed between the flash of the bulb and the light returning back to the bulb must be larger for the stationary observer than the time
        elapsed for the observer inside the train.
        <br><br>
        The train, lightbulb and light beam all travel a horizontal distance of vt1 during the elapsed time t1, and a vertical distance of 2h. Using trigonometry
        we can <span id="distance-calc">derive an expression</span> for the distance travelled by the light beam as d1 = sqrt(4h^2+v^2t1^2).
      </p>
      <img src="diagrams/Diagram_3.png" alt="Diagram 3">
      <p>
        Again using distance = speed * time, <span id="time-calc">we can calculate</span> the elapsed time as t1 = 2h/sqrt(c^2-v^2).
        <br><br>
        This experiment shows how time is a <span id="rel-quantity">relative quantity</span> between observers moving at different relative speeds; time passes
        at different rates for each of them.
        <br><br>
        The two differing elapsed times calculated by the two observers can be <span id="time-dilation">related to each other</span>, resulting in the equation
        t1 = γ * t0, where t1 is the time elapsed as observed by the stationary observer, t0 is the time elapsed for the observer inside the train, and γ is a
        quantity known as the Lorentz factor.
        <br><br>
        In this formula, t0 is named the proper time and always refers to the time observed by the potential observer who witnessed the beginning event (the flash
        of the light bulb) and the ending event (the light wave returning to the bulb) at the same point in space.

        In this example the observer who was inside the train was the one who witnessed these events occurring in the same place, so they recorded the proper time.
        The stationary observer witnessed them occurring at different places, because the train was moving within their reference frame.
        <br><br>
        The ‘proper time’ t0 is no more 'proper' than any observed t1; both elapsed times that were calculated were equally valid within their own frames of
        reference.
