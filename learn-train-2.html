        Consider an observer who is inside a moving train with velocity v, and another observer standing stationary outside of
        the train. Using the theory of special relativity, they can perform many experiments with light waves that show that
        time is flowing at different relative speeds between them. 

        Here is one such experiment. The observer on the train places a mirror flat on the train floor, and flashes a light
        bulb on the roof of the train such that a light wave travels from the bulb, directly down onto the mirror, and back up
        to the bulb.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the observer inside the train’s perspective, the light travelled directly downwards and then directly upwards.
        The time between the flash and the light returning to the bulb is therefore equal to the distance traveled, which is
        twice the height of the train, divided by the speed of light c, giving t = 2h/c .

        However the observer outside the train would witness this event in a different way because while the light is making
        its journey up and down, the train is also moving within their reference frame from left to right.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The light must travel a larger distance from the stationary observer’s perspective, but the speed of light would still
        be observed to be constant at c. Therefore, the time elapsed between the flash of the bulb and the light returning back
        to the bulb must be larger for the stationary observer than the time elapsed for the observer inside the train. We can
        <span>calculate this time</span> as t = 2h/sqrt(c^2-v^2) .

        This experiment shows how time is a <span>relative quantity</span> between observers moving at different relative
        speeds, and time passes at different rates for each of them.

        The two differing elapsed times calculated by the two observers can be related to each other, resulting in the equation
        t1 = γ * t0, where t1 is the time elapsed as observed by the stationary observer, and t0 is the time elapsed for the
        observer inside the train.

        In this formula, t0 always refers to the time observed by the observer who witnessed the beginning event (the flash of
        the light bulb) and the ending event (the light wave returning to the bulb) at the same point in space.

        In this example the observer who was inside the train was the one who witnessed these events occurring in the same
        place, while the stationary observer witnessed them occurring at different places, because the train was moving within
        their reference frame.

        This elapsed time t0 is referred to as the ‘proper time’, however it is no more correct than t1; both elapsed times
        that were calculated were equally valid within their own frames of reference.
