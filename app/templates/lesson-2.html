					Here is one such experiment. The observer on the train places a mirror flat on the train floor, and
					flashes a light bulb on the roof of the train such that a light wave travels from the bulb, directly
					down onto the mirror, and back up to the bulb.

					2h/c.
					<br /><br />
					However the observer outside the train would witness this event in a different way because while the
					light is making its journey up and down, the train is also moving within their reference frame from

					In this formula, t0 is named the proper time and always refers to the time observed by the potential

					light wave returning to the bulb) at the same point in space. In this example the observer who was
					inside the train was the one who witnessed these events occurring in the same place, so they
					recorded the proper time. The stationary observer witnessed them occurring at different places,
					because the train was moving within their reference frame.

					The ‘proper time’ t0 is no more 'proper' than any observed t1; both elapsed times that were
					calculated were equally valid within their own frames of reference.
