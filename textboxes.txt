"speed-of-light" : The speed of light is constant at 299,792,458 m/s.

"rel-motion" : This means that an observer who is travelling towards a light source and an observer travelling away from the light source will still both measure the speed of the light wave to be the same.

"inertial" : An inertial frame of reference is a ‘place’ such as on Earth or inside a rocket ship in which all of Newton’s laws are valid. Inside an inertial frame of reference an object with no forces acting on it will travel at a constant velocity in a straight line.

"space-time" : Space-time refers to the 4-dimensional expanse that consists of up/down, left/right, in/out and also the one-dimensional flow of time from past towards future. It is the combination of space and time into one ‘place’ that objects can exist within.

"rel-quantities" : Length/distance is also a relative quantity, however we will be focusing on time throughout this tutorial.
